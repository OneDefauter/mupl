##### Example of {data}
The date can be defined in several different ways.

**{1d}** == In 1 day

**{5h}** == In 5 hours

**{40m}** == In 40 minutes

**{30s}** == In 30 seconds

Or in the common format.
**{2024-01-16 22-00-00}**

You can also combine them.
**{1d 5h 40m 30s}** == In 1 day, 5 hours, 40 minutes, and 30 seconds

You don't need to worry about the order.
**{30s 5h 1d 40m}**

Don't keep the values together; otherwise, it won't work.
**{1d5h40m30s}**

## Name to ID map
The `name_id_map.json` has the follwing format:
```json
{
    "manga": {
        "hyakkano": "efb4278c-a761-406b-9d69-19603c5e4c8b"
    },
    "group": {
        "XuN": "b6d57ade-cab7-4be7-b2b8-be68484b3ad3"
    }
}
```
`manga` and `group` comtain the map of name to ID for the manga to upload to and group to upload to respectively. The name should be the same as the upload file. To avoid potential problems when uploading, try use a name that is lowercase and doesn't have spaces.

Each new name-id pair should be separated by a comma at the end of the line and a colon between the name and ID. The last pair of each map should not have a comma.

#### Example

Take `hyakkano - c025 (v04) [XuN].cbz` as the chapter I want to upload. In my `name_id_map.json`, I would have the key `hyakkano` and the value `efb4278c-a761-406b-9d69-19603c5e4c8b` for the manga ID to upload to. I would also have `XuN` for the group map with the value `b6d57ade-cab7-4be7-b2b8-be68484b3ad3`.

The program would then look through this file for the `hyakkano` key and for the `XuN` key for their assigned ids.

If I have a file named `efb4278c-a761-406b-9d69-19603c5e4c8b [spa] - 000 (Momi-san) [XuN+00e03853-1b96-4f41-9542-c71b8692033b]`, the progam would take the manga id directly from the file, the language as Spanish with the code `es`, chapter number as null (oneshot) with no volume, chapter title as `Momi-san` with groups `XuN` (id taken form `name_id_map.json`) and `00e03853-1b96-4f41-9542-c71b8692033b`.

## Translation
There are two files to translate, this Doc and the [/mupl/loc/en.json](/mupl/loc/en.json) file. 

The translated Doc should be placed in [/doc/](/doc/) with the name `Doc.<>.md` with the ISO language code between the periods, for example: `Doc.pt-br.md`.

The translated json file should be the named `<>.json` with the ISO language code being used and placed inside the directory [/mupl/loc/](/mupl/loc/). 

Please submit a PR with these changes.
